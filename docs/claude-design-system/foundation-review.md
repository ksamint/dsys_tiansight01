# Foundation review · 基础层评审

Per-token register of the export-vs-published conflict, with the ruling of 2026-09-07: **the published guide (v0.6) wins every conflict**; layers the guide leaves open keep the export's proposal and are marked PROPOSED until the brand directory publishes them.

Sources: `brand/guide.md` v0.6, `brand/source.json` (snapshot 74a829b), `TIANSIGHT 侍天 Design System/tokens/*.css`.

## Verdict

The export and the published guide differ on more than values. `#EFE6D2` is the **primary brand color** in the guide (fields, key actions, ≈7% of a view) and the **whole page ground** in the export. That one role decision drives every other color relation in the export, so it is ruled first and everything else follows.

`brand/` already implements the ruling. This document records why, row by row, so the decisions are auditable when the guide moves.

## Beyond the foundation

Recorded, not resolved here: two product narratives (经营五问 · 三层+X vs 海图/罗盘/航线/校正 · L1–L5), two price ladders (export unpriced; guide's four tiers), and the fact that `scripts/check.py` originally never compared the export to the guide.

## Answers to README open questions, from the ruling

- **Q4 mark** — published asset; compass drawn only as watermark. Agrees with `brand/`.
- **Q5 semantic chart colors** — no, until published. Three-series rule; 增长/关注 separated by label. A warm semantic set (`--growth #4E6B3F`, `--caution #B98B2A`, `--datum #6E6355`) is the submission if the report needs it.
- **Q7 first consumer** — website.
- **Q9 offer** — guide's four tiers.
- **Q11 charcoal deck grounds** — under "published wins", the guide allows `--surface` + `--paper` only. Both resolutions are rendered side by side in `Q11 Deck Grounds.dc.html`: **A** keeps the charcoal opener/closer and needs a §7 amendment (charcoal permitted for deck cover and close only, ≤ 2 slides, mark on an `--ink-primary` tile, plus a `check.py` assertion); **B** returns slides 01/13 to `--surface` with the compass watermark, drops `.mark-tile` except inside `.ts-card-charcoal`, and refreshes `snapshots/layout.json`. Recommendation: B, so deck, website and report share one ground rule. **Ruled 2026-09-08: B.** Commit-ready changes in `repo-patch/Q11-B-deck-pale-grounds.md`.

## Ruling 2026-09-09 · mark lockup

The mark already reads 侍天; the CN name is never set beside it. Header lockup = mark + Latin caption "Tiansight"; footers = mark + "Tiansight". Applied across tiansight-ds; for the repo: website/index.html, website/team.html, brand/index.html, report/index.html, deck/index.html footers, guide §6.
